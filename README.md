# ChatServer

## Description
This app was made as a training. It works  together with the app [ChatClient](https://github.com/dmdn/ChatClient).
Before starting the **ChatClient** app, it is necessary that the **ChatServer** app is already running.

### Technical task
#### Implement the program with the requirements:
+ Application Name: **ChatServer**.
+ The program must open a server socket on port "1234".
+ When connecting a client, the program (**ChatServer**) should output all that the client (**ChatClient**) sent.
+ The incoming message from one user was sent immediately to all users who are currently connected to the server.
+ When a new user was connected, the last 10 messages were shown to him.
+ The program should monitor the number of connected users and not allow more users to connect than 10.

### Version of the project:
